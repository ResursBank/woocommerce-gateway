This is a rewritten fork of Resurs Bank payment gateway for WooCommerce


== Description ==

In the initial days of Resurs ecommerce a plugin was developed to support Resurs Bank in the gateway-verse of WooCommerce. It was, just like this one, released as third party edition for Resurs Bank payment flows.

When time passed, the source code got a bit unhandy to develop with, but since the code was already sent to production environments it was also dependent on functionality. Breaking something in this state is basically not good for business.

This version of the plugin is a rebuild-fork of the prior one, and a try to free some bottlenecks.

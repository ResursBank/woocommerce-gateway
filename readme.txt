Resurs Bank Payment Gateway for WooCommerce.
Maintenance release.


== Description ==

= Important Notes =

As of v2.2.12, we do support SWISH and similar "instant debitable" payment methods, where payments tend to be finalized/debited long before shipping has been made. You can read more about it [here](https://test.resurs.com/docs/display/ecom/CHANGELOG+-+WooCommerce#CHANGELOG-WooCommerce-2.2.12)


= About =

This is a payment gateway for Resurs Bank, that supports three Resurs Bank shopflows. Depending on which flow that's being selected, there are also requirements on different communication drivers, but in short - to get full control over this plugin - it is good to have them all available.


= Compatibility =

The plugin was once written for WooCommerce v2.6 and up but as of today, we've started to change the requirements. It is no longer guaranteed that this plugin is compatible with such old versions. Ever since WooCommerce [discoverd a file deletion vulnerable (click here)](https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/wordpress-design-flaw-leads-to-woocommerce-rce/) our goal is to patch away deprecated functions.

 * Compatibility: WooCommerce - at least 3.x and up to 3.5 (it might eventually work with older versions too, however this will remain unconfirmed)
 * Plugin verified with PHP version 5.4 - 7.3
 * Plugin verified with WordPress 5.0 alpha
 * Addon scripts verified with PHP 5.3 - 7.3 (EComPHP 1.3.x and NetCURL 6.0.20+)


== Can I upgrade WooCommerce with your plugin installed? ==

If unsure about upgrades, take a look at resursbankgateway.php under "WC Tested up to". That section usually changes (after internal tests has been made) to match the base requirements, so you can upgrade without upgrade warnings.

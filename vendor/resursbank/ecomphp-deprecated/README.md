# resursbank/ecomphp-deprecated #

This is a repository for revoked content of primarily ECOMPHP v1.3.
To make it easier to transform the currently broken support of PSR-4, we try to separate the most obsolete parts from the current release first - and hereafter import this repo as a compatiblity set instead.

For those who still use older classes and definitions that belongs to the broken class handling, is in this way given a chance to replace that data before upgrading to something newer. Moving the broken content out of the live package into a more PSR-compliant but deprecation marked package, shold not be affected by this.

### How do I get set up? ###

Use composer as usual.

    composer install resursbank/ecomphp

When reaching a specific version of v1.3, this library will be imported automatically.

### Who do I talk to about this? ###

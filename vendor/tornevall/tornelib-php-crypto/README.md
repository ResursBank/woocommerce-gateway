# MODULE_CRYPTO + MODULE_IO

Maintenance edition. Take a look at 6.1 instead.
Repository is now only merging 6.0 maintenance updates into stable/6.0 since the cryptolib 6.1 takes over completely.

## Caution!

Crypto 6.1 contains crypto only! The IO library has been separated into its own repository. If you are building something, do not use master!

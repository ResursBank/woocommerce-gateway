# NETCURL

[Full documents are located here](https://docs.tornevall.net/x/KwCy)

## This package is about to get deprecated

Documentation for v6.1 is located [here](https://docs.tornevall.net/display/TORNEVALL/NETCURLv6.1).
Read that or [the 6.1 README.md](https://bitbucket.tornevall.net/projects/LIB/repos/tornelib-php-netcurl/browse/README.md) instead of this file.

Stable releases for v6.0 will, for now on, be pushed into stable/6.0, instead of the master branch.
The branch itself should probably be considered a maintenance repo only. Code that is utilized by v6.1 could
in a near future be imported here.
